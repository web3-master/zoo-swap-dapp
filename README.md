### 📝 Description
This is react.js based front-end application for our decentralized token exchange service.
<br/>
Now it has the following features.
#### 1. Wallet connection
It only supports MetaMask now but I will grow this to support many more wallets.
#### 2. Swap
You can swap between ethereum and zoo token.
<br/>
Zoo token is ERC20 token that will be used in our zoo nft market.
<br/>
All transaction is charged 0.3% of input token as fee.
#### 3. Liquidity Pool
Now it only supports ethereum-zoo token pair in the pool.
<br/>
Investers can deposit and withdraw their assets freely.
<br/>
Of course, accumulated transaction fees will be shared to investers according to liquidity.
